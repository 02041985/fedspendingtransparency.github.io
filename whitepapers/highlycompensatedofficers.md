# Element: Top 5 Highly Compensated Officers

As of May 8, 2015, 15 of the data elements below have been finalized, and those can be found [here](https://max.gov/maxportal/assets/public/offm/DataStandardsFinal.htm "Federal Spending Transparency Data Standards").  12 of the below elements have proposed standard definitions that are now open for public feedback, and will be finalized after feedback is analyzed. For the remaining 30 elements, we have posted their current, longstanding definitions. These are open for feedback as we continue the standardization process so that this feedback can be incorporated into discussions in real time. We will update these pages throughout the summer with more information and the proposed definitions as they are developed. Please click _Get Updates_ above to receive emails as we update these pages.

## Background

The Government Funding Transparency Act of 2008, which amended FFATA, required that awardees report the names and total compensation of the five most highly compensated officers.  This information had not been specifically collected by the federal government prior to the FFATA requirement.

## Context

For the procurement community, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 4.14 was updated to allow for the collection of this information from prime and subcontractors.  
For the financial assistance community, the Code of Federal Regulations was also updated to allow for the collection from prime and subrecipients (2 CFR Part 170).  2 CFR Part 170.320 defines the federal assistance vehicles subject to this reporting requirement.

When the definition of “total compensation” was established during the proposed FAR rule, to ensure consistency it was compared to other definitions of types of “compensation” that already existed in FAR Part 3 related to improper business processes and personal conflicts of interest and Part 31 related to cost principles and allowable costs.   The term “executive” was also established defined as a part of the proposed rule, and it was compared to FAR Part 3 to ensure consistency.

## Analysis of Current Definitions

There were no concerns raised or alternative definitions suggested by representatives of the procurement and financial assistance communities.  The definitions have been through the public rulemaking process, and there are no known issues with the definitions.
