## Background

The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA), 2006, established requirements for Federal agencies to report Federal award actions to a central, publicly accessible website (USASpending.gov) and identified data that must be reported.  FFATA was amended in 2008 to require additional data reporting.  FFATA was further amended in 2014 by the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA) to, among other items, require summary financial data be reported by Federal agencies in addition to federal award data.

Section 2(b)(1) of the FFATA requires that (1) the name of the entity receiving the award, (2) a unique identifier of the entity receiving the award, and (3) a unique identifier of the parent entity of the recipient, should the entity be owned by another entity, be included when reporting federal award actions.

FFATA defines “entity” as any legal business organization, such as a profit or nonprofit corporation, partnership; limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or a sole proprietorship; any other grantee or contractor that is not an individual recipient of Federal assistance or a Federal employee; and any State or locality.  For an organization with subsidiaries, the ultimate parent is the top tier of the organization.

## Context

Accurate and timely identification of responsible Federal award partners is essential to ensuring the integrity of the Federal awarding processes and the best use of taxpayer dollars.  A unique entity identifier is required to, among other things, verify entity information, location, past performance, integrity data, incorporation information, provide payment, and create transparency.   Since 1995<sup>1</sup>, the Federal government has identified the Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS&#174;) as the unique identifier used to standardize identification of Federal contractors.  This decision was the result of task force recommendations developed in support of the requirements of President Clinton’s October 1993 memo on Streamlining Procurement through Electronic Commerce.  The task force recommended the use of the DUNS&#174; as it was recognized domestically and internationally for identifying businesses conducting electronic commerce.  The task force recommendations did not preclude use of different identifiers as circumstances changed.

To standardize implementation of FFATA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued memorandum M-08-04, dated November 9, 2007, which established the use of the DUNS&#174; number as the unique identifier for transparency reporting.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Code of Federal Regulations (2 CFR) include requirements for a unique identifier for Federal prime and subawardees.

Over the past 20 years, however, data and information technology capabilities have changed and circumstances in the Federal award community have evolved.  Congress has enacted legislation that requires expanded identification of entities working with the Federal government and the development of policies to better trace Federal dollars from appropriation to final outcomes or results.  While key information needed to verify legal businesses may reside in a few providers, options for uniquely identifying those working with the Federal government have expanded.   As a result, the Federal government is changing the FAR and 2 CFR to remove the proprietary references of DUNS&#174; and instead refer to a “unique entity identifier”.

Additionally, the DUNS&#174; number is the primary identifier with which entities register in the System for Award Management (SAM).  The DUNS&#174; number is tied in SAM to the legal business name, doing business as name, and the physical address that corresponds to it, as recorded by D&B.  The DUNS&#174; number and name fields are not editable in SAM by the entity registering; to change the data, the entity must update their information with D&B first, and then update their SAM record.  Entities awarded Federal procurement and grants actions, with limited exceptions, are required by FAR Subpart 4.11 and 2 CFR to register in SAM and this registration also includes a requirement to for a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.

An entity’s ultimate parent organization is maintained by D&B (referred to as the global parent by D&B).  When an entity registers in SAM, the parent’s DUNS&#174; number is provided, along with the parent’s legal business name.

While the proprietary references are being removed, the requirement for standardized and unique identification of entities remains.  There are significant risks to removing a single standard and changing identifiers on a regular basis and these include loss in data integrity, inability to identify responsible parties, consideration of appropriate past performance, and costs to change financial, grants, and procurements systems government-wide.

The Federal government is mitigating these risks for taxpayers by using a data standard for a unique identifier that is governed by the interagency Award Committee for E-Government (ACE) and managed by the General Services Administration’s Integrated Award Environment (IAE).  Governing the changes through the ACE will ensure Federal-wide stakeholders are engaged.  Managing through the IAE will ensure consistency in application for all Federal awardees.

## Analysis of Current Definitions

The definitions and protocol currently used in the Federal government to uniquely identify entities for Federal award purposes are as follows:

* _Awardee/Recipient Unique Identifier_: the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS&#174;) Number – The 9-digit number assigned by Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the unique entity identifier for Federal Awardees/Recipients.
* _Awardee/Recipient Legal Business Name_:  The name of the awardee/recipient that relates to the Awardee DUNS&#174; Number.  For U.S. based companies, this name is what the business ordinarily files in its formation documents with the individual states (when this is required).
* _Ultimate Parent Unique Identifier_: Awardee/Recipient Parent DUNS&#174; Number – The 9-digit number assigned by Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) that uniquely identifies the ultimate parent (as determined by D&B) related to the Awardee/Recipient DUNS&#174; Number; used as the unique parent entity identifier for Federal Awardees/Recipients.
* _Ultimate Parent Legal Business Name_:  Awardee/Recipient Parent Legal Business Name – The name of the ultimate parent of the awardee/recipient that relates to the Awardee/Recipient Parent DUNS&#174; Number.

The “Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS&#174;) number” is currently defined in the FAR as “the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.”  The DUNS&#174; number was, until recently, defined in 2 CFR Part 25 as “the nine-digit number established and assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to uniquely identify business entities.”

Note that legal business name, parent DUNS&#174; number, and parent legal business name are not specifically defined in the FAR or 2 CFR, but are necessary to comply with FFATA.  Legal business name is used to distinguish from the use of various ‘tradestyle’ or ‘doing business as’ names.

Going forward, the Federal government will explore potential alternatives to meet the requirement for a unique identifier currently met by use of the DUNS&#174; number.  Any changes to the use of the DUNS&#174; number for these processes will require resources to change agencies’ financial, grants, and procurement systems as well as systems supporting government-wide systems used for analysis or display of data.  This will be a significant and lengthy effort to review and implement any suggested changes.

## Recommended Definitions for Transparency Reporting

For the data standardization effort, there are no changes recommended at this time to the existing standard for unique entity identifier.  This mitigates costs to taxpayers as well as risks to the integrity of the Federal awarding process by continuing the use of an existing standards while exploring alternatives for both the identifier and other aspects of the award process associated with a unique entity identifier.
