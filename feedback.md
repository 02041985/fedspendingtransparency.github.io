# Commenting on the Data Elements

To comment on the data elements, you will need a Github account. You can sign up for one at [github.com](http://github.com).

Each data element listed on the [data elements page](/dataelements) has a corresponding Github issue that is linked in the name of the data element. If you would like to view the current discussion or comment on a data element definition, click on the data element name to be taken straight to the issue page.


# Commenting on Missing Elements

If you think a data element is missing, but should be included in the proposed data standard for federal spending data, please take the following steps:

- [Create a new issue](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/fedspendingtransparency.github.io/issues/new)
- In the title field, put the working title of the element you wish to propose
- in the "Labels" column to the right of the title field, click the "proposed element" label to add it to the issue
- in the comment field, describe the element you are proposing, as well as why it should be in the standard

# Milestones

Because of the number of data elements that we are gathering feedback on, we will be releasing the data element definitions for comment in two week intervals. Each two week interval will have its own milestone. When viewing open issues on the [issues page](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/fedspendingtransparency.github.io/issues/) you can filter the issues by milestone to see which ones are currently open for comment. 

Once a milestone has passed, we will close and archive the issues related to that milestone so that we can focus our outreach efforts on the current set of data element definitions open for discussion. The team working on the spending standard is limited, and we want a chance to fully engage on all of the elements.
