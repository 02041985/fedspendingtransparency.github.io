# The Data Exchange Standard

This page contains information on the standard data exchange, as part of the implementation of the DATA Act. The standard is under active development and consists of two main parts:

1.	The DATA Act Schema, or the generic model of the relationships between the data elements
2.	Specific implementations of this schema in XBRL, XML, JSON, and other formats (also called the taxonomy)

Currently, the working version of the standard covers a subset of both financial data and award level data. The Department of the Treasury, along with agency partners, is working to release incremental versions of the standard that regularly incorporate feedback from agencies, the public, and other stakeholders. The information on this page is a work in progress and does not represent official guidance from the U.S. Treasury on the USSGL.

## Current Draft Version (v0.5)

This version of the data standard focuses includes the financial level as well as additional elements related to the award level information. As part of this release, there are two parts: a Word document describing the schema, and an XML implementation of the schema.
