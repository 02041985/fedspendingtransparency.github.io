# Open Data Engagement

So you’re opening up government data and making it easier to find and use – to inspire new ideas, spur economic growth, and ultimately make your agency more effective in achieving its mission. But you realize that your agency can’t just supply data – it’s also about getting and acting upon feedback, and catalyzing use of the data from a wide variety of stakeholders.  A community event is a great way to hear ideas and feedback from passionate people, offer your expertise to people with thoughtful questions and evangelize your data assets. This document gives an overview of the main types of open data community events the U.S. Government holds.

## Data Jam

A closed-press, day-long ideation event with developers, designers, and subject matter experts focused on one topic and top related open data sets. Several are held in succession, leading up to a datapalooza three months later. *Ex: Health Data jam (HHS), 21st Century Jobs Jam (OVP, Commerce, OSTP), Mitigating Campus Sexual Assault (Department of Education, Department of Justice)*

**Goal:** To connect tech and policy communities and get commitments to make things with open data, in support of agency mission and priorities.

## Datapalooza
An open press celebration, demo day, and platform to announce government open data releases or improvements. *Ex: Safety Datapalooza (DOT, CPSC, FDA.)*

**Goal:** To celebrate open data tools, companies and commitments and build momentum for projects.

## Hackathon
An event where developers, designers, and strategists work in teams to solve problems with software and/or hardware and demo the resulting work at the end of the day.
*Ex: White House “We The People” API Hackathon, The American Art API Hackathon*

**Goal:** To build relationships with the tech community and to see immediate tools and prototypes.
