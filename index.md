#We Need Your Feedback! 

With the recent enactment of the “Digital Accountability Transparency Act” (DATA Act) [(Pub. L. 113-101)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ101/html/PLAW-113publ101.htm), the Federal Government is working to establish government-wide financial data standards and increase the availability, accuracy, and usefulness of federal spending information. 

Collaboration across the Federal Government and with external stakeholders is critical to the successful implementation of the DATA Act. We would like to use this collaboration space to foster a two way communication and collaboration with both Federal and non-Federal stakeholders. 


##How to Participate

Take a look at the [data elements being considered for publication](dataelements/). Is something missing? Do you have thoughts on how a particular data element should be defined? Do you have questions about a data element? 

We are using [Github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to track the conversation and changes around each data element. You'll find that each data element has its own issue, and is appropriately tagged with a category (such as awardee or account information). If you think a data element is missing, create an issue and add the tag: "proposed element". Otherwise, comment on the existing issue for that data element to join the discussion.

*For additional information on how to provide feedback, click [here](feedback/).*


##The Timeline

Because there are many data elements to discuss, we will be asking for comments on specific data elements in two-week rounds. Each data element will have it's own issue, with an associated milestone so you can easily see how long the comments will be open. We will begin soliciting comments on the specific data element definitions starting in February. 


##Background Materials 

Here you will find white papers that have been produced by our Interagency Advisory Committee on the data element definitions.
