#Thanks for Helping Us Improve Government Data

The Latest

On December 31, 2015, version 0.7 of the DATA Act Schema was released. It builds on version 0.6 by adding semantic and contextual metadata, attributes, and missing elements. You can read about, download, and comment on this latest information model schema here. [link]       

About Federal Spending Transparency

With enactment of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), the federal government has taken huge strides toward   increasing the availability, accuracy, and usefulness of federal spending information. Led by the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget, federal agencies are working to upgrade the data they will provide to an updated USASpending.gov by 2017. 

This collaboration space is designed to openly share our process for meeting the new data transparency requirements of the DATA Act, and to engage the public and federal agencies in decisionmaking along the way.

Our Workstreams and Where to Find Them

Data In

The Data Elements: The new version of USASpending.gov will rely on 57 distinct data elements to tell the story of how federal dollars are spent. After robust public comment, these elements have been finalized and clearly defined. You can see them here.

The Data Schema:  The DATA Act Schema organizes all the elements into a structure that further defines, groups, and relates them to each other. You can see (and comment on) schema diagrams and XML files here. 

The Data Broker:  Getting data uploaded to USA Spending is a two-part process: validation to ensure quality, and transmission to the cloud in a specific format so it can be displayed on the website. Learn how we are building a data broker to enable agencies to do both things here.

Data Out

USAspending.gov: This public website was launched in 2007, and already features robust access to  federal spending data mandated by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006.  

Open Beta:  This is the public beta site for the next release of USAspending.gov. It has pilot data that allows you to test out features and give us feedback on designs and visualizations.

Usability

User research, testing, and design iteration will undergird all parts of the DATA Act implementation. Learn about our process here
