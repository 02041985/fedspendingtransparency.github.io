#Thanks for Helping Us Improve Government Data

On August 31, 2015 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) released the complete list of standardized data elements. Each of the 57 data standards was open on GitHub for three weeks of public input.  After considering input from both federal and non-federal stakeholders, we have finalized standard definitions for use across the government. Standardization of these elements will help facilitate increased government efficiency and transparency.  In addition to input on specific proposed data definitions, we have also received great feedback on ideas for new/additional data elements to further standardize.  Moving forward, weâ€™ll be developing a process to review and, if necessary, update the final data standards and consider additional data elements for standardization      


With the enactment of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) [(Pub. L. No. 113-101)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ101/html/PLAW-113publ101.htm) and our ongoing efforts to improve federal spending data under the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA), the federal government has established government-wide financial data standards which will  increase the availability, accuracy, and usefulness of federal spending information. 

The overall data standardization effort consists of two parallel, yet related, efforts:

1.	Standardizing the definition of 57 financial and award data standards (complete on August 31, 2015); and
2.	Creating a data exchange standard that prescribes how to transmit these elements between agencies and how to display the data to the public.

The data exchange standard broadly refers to the DATA Act Schema.  The DATA Act Schema depicts the relationships between data elements and the format-specific implementations of the schema.  Furthermore, data validation requirements are specifically expressed in the DATA Act Schema and a rules file linked to the schema. 

During the data element standardization process, we relied on input from both federal and non-federal stakeholders, which helped us better understand how stakeholders report and use data.  The public input we received informed our work, and we responded by updating the white papers we posted on [GitHub]({{ site.baseurl }}/dataelements/).  As we continue our implementation efforts, the discussion threads on data standards we opened in December 2014 will remain open. Please continue to post your thoughts and propose additional data elements for standardization. We also look forward to reading your feedback on future releases of the DATA Act Schema.  You can discuss the data exchange standard (including the DATA Act Schema and any example implementations) on any issue with the label  [data exchange standard](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/fedspendingtransparency.github.io/labels/data%20exchange%20standard). You can also keep track of past conversations and our current work on the [data exchange standard page]({{ site.baseurl }}/data-exchange-standard/).

Again, we thank everyone who provided feedback during the data standardization process.  Your feedback has served a significant role in helping to define data standards across the federal government.  OMB and Treasury will continue to leverage GitHub to consult with stakeholders as agencies work to realize the full potential of the DATA Act.
