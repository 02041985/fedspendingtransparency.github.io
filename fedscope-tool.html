  <h5 style="margin-bottom:1.3rem">How this analysis was conducted:</h5>
  <p style="margin-bottom:2rem">This analysis was conducted using federal agency obligations data reported to USAspending.gov, which is available to the public, and agency employment data made available by the Office of Personnel Management at FedScope.OPM.gov. Personnel obligations data was used to identify the cost of personnel compensation across the government and for each agency. FedScope employment data was used to verify the personnel data reported to USAspending and evaluate the distribution of employees across the country. Fedscope data was also used to determine the composition of government employees, as well as for the agency specific staff profiles.</p>
