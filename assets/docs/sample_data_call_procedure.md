## Background 

Many agencies have an incomplete inventory of their data assets.  Open data teams often find that a distributed data call is a good means of filling in the gaps.  Below is a model for this.  

There are two principle models for this - one where you direct each participant to populate a spreadsheet and the other where you direct them to input new entries into a system such as CKAN.  The below focuses on the first model.  

## Steps 

1.  The central coordinator should consolidate your current inventory in an authoritative copy.  It's important to maintain version control from this point forward.  
2.  Parse the current inventory into sections based on your organization's components (e.g. by agency or bureau).  
3.  Require each component to provide one or more empowered data representatives.  
4.  Provide each representative with instructions (draft memo below) and their appropriate section of the current data inventory.  
5.  Each representative should then confirm the entries and their metadata in the current inventory, then ask the question of what datasets from their component are unaccounted for in this inventory.  
6. The representatives should systematically add new rows for existing datasets that had been recorded in the inventory.  
*  As appropriate, the representatives should coordinate with other staff in order to include all required metadata for each entry as well as as much optional metadata as possible.  
*  The representatives themselves may need to coordinate a data call within their component in order to scale this process to the full expanse of their component's data offerings.  
*  If needed, the representative may need to systematically browse their component's web presence in order to find the myriad datasets that are offered but had not been accounted for in the inventory.  
7. The representative is responsible for returning to the central coordinator an updated spreadsheet that includes the original inventory but then expands on it.  The column structure should remain the same so that the central coordinator can easily re-assemble the organization's inventory.  
8. The central coordinator should carefully combine the updated inventories, ensuring that each spreadsheet's columns have remained consistant and that each spreadsheet contains not just additions but the original inventory material as well.  
9. Upon completion, the central coordinator should certify the expanded inventory as the new authoritative copy.
