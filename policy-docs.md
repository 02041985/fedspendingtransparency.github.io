This section offers examples of policy documents (memos, guidance, manuals, etc) on open data and data management as inspiration for other agencies.  

## Memos

* Department of the Interior, ["Memo Re: Implementation of DOI Open Data Policy"](/assets/docs/MEMO_RE_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_DOI_OPEN_DATA_POLICY.pdf). This memo served as the official DOI announcement to all Department Bureaus and Offices of the near-term requirements of M-13-13, and also called for the creation of a Data Services Board to oversee data lifecycle management moving forward.

## Guidance

* [Sample Procedure for an agency-wide data call](http://project-open-data.github.io/assets/docs/sample_data_call_procedure).
