# Federal Spending Data Elements

The lists on this page contain two types of federal spending data elements:

1. Existing Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) data elements, which are currently featured on USAspending.gov
2. Additional data elements required by the DATA Act that will be featured on USASpending.gov once the DATA Act is fully implemented.

The elements on these lists are currently being discussed by members of the federal community as part of the DATA Act.

At the current time, these lists are exhaustive. That said, the federal community is aware of agencies’ and the larger community’s needs and may add and standardize new elements to improve transparency reporting moving forward.

The data elements are grouped by category; each short list represents a different category. In addition, each element has its own GitHub issue, which is where you can add to the discussion on that element. To share your thoughts, simply click on the name of an element to be rerouted to its GitHub issue page, where you can leave your feedback in the blank comment box.

If you’d like to propose an entirely new element, please create a new issue according to our [contribution guidelines](/feedback).
