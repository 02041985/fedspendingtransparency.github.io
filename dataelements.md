## Federal Spending Data Elements 

The data elements in the below list represent the existing Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) data elements currently displayed on [USAspending.gov](http://www.usaspending.gov/) and the additional data elements that will be posted pursuant to the DATA Act. These elements are currently being deliberated on and discussed by the Federal community as a part of DATA Act implementation. At this point, this list is exhaustive. However, additional data elements may be standardized for transparency reporting in the future based on agency or community needs.
